                Are you done with horrible theatrics and want something that feels truly raw? Do you want something so explosive, yet so believably brutal that you wince, but cannot look away - instead, staring enamored by the performance in front of you?
                <br /><br />
                Should this interest you, then Knuckles Championship
                Wrestling is the promotion for you! Whether you be a fan or
                a talent in the business, you have a home here.
                <br /><br />
                KCW prides itself on the old school wrestling presentation,
                with the comforts of modern wrestling styles. With managers
                harken back to Bobby Heenan and Paul Bearer, charismatic
                speakers are welcome. If that isn't your thing, then perhaps
                commentators will suit you, as you call the action as it
                plays out in the ring. As for our referees, you too can be an
                Earl Hebner or Charles Robinson! And finally, for those who
                toned up their athletic and combative abilities, we are proud
                to announce that we have a diverse blend of styles and feel
                strongly about inclusivity. Tap in, or tap out!
                <br /><br />
                For interested talent, take a look at our team, our classes,
